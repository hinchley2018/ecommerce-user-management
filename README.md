# ecommerce-user-management
- javascript utilities to deal with user management in our mock e-commerce website
- intended to be used on server-side

## Getting started
- clone project locally (fork if outside of Fake-Amazon INC)
- open project in vscode
- run tests `node user-utilities.test.js` (in real-world we would use jest...)

## Usage
- require the module `const userUtilities = require('./user-utilities')` (in real-world there would be some package installation steps)
- now you can use the exported utilities in your code...
